# Website-Template
A template to use for a personal website! 

There are four different files in this repo: 
1. **index.html** (template for this website with several in-line comments explaining tags and HTML concepts)
2. **index_finished.html** (a filled out template with my information with comments)
3. **index_uncommented.html** (template for this website without comments)
4. **index_finished_uncommented.html** (a filled out template with my information without comments)

Pick your favorite file to edit, but if you're uploading this to Github later and not using "index.html" make sure to rename your file to "index.html" because that's the file that Github loads on Github Pages.

## A Brief Overview of HTML Tags
* `<head>`: Where we link to external stylesheets, specify a favicon, and list any metadata.
⋅⋅* `<title>`: Normally inside of `<head>`, the title of the webpage and what shows up in the tab.
⋅⋅* `<link>`: Normally inside of `<head>`, allows us to reference files outside of this HTML file.
* `<body>`: Contains all the content that someone will see on the website.
* `<div>`: A way to group together related content.
* `<img>`: An image. Normally contains a `src` attribute that tells the webpage where to get the image from. Should also include an `alt` attribute that describes what the image is for accessibility.
* `<p>`: Stands for paragraph. Used when you want to display some text.
* `<a>`: Used for links. Normally contains a `href` atrtibute, which specifies what the content is linked to.
* `<ul>`: An unordered list (uses bullet points). The parent container of list items.  
* `<ol>`: An ordered list (uses numbers instead of bullet points). The parent container of list items.
* `<li>`: A list item. Must be nested inside of either `<ul>` or `<ol>`.	
* `<br/>`: A line break. It's self-closing!
